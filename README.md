# Institution-Segmentation
In summary, I use Kmean to cluster institutions in this project. The clustering results provide us with an overarching view that helps students make admissions decisions to achieve their educational and financial goals. Knowing which group their target school belongs to, they can have more options to apply to some other schools with similar characteristics.
